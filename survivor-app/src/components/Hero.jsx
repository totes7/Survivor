        Survivor is the story of a young boy caught up in the horrors of the
        Holocaust, told by Zoom Rockman using a unique animation style with
        paper puppets. Zoom met Ivor, a 92- year-old Holocaust survivor, in the
        summer of 2023. Ivor left a lasting impression on Zoom, inspiring him to
        share Ivorâ€™s story, which remains relevant today. The film captures the
        full spectrum of humanity and inhumanity, allowing audiences to derive
        their own insights and reflections.
