        <h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
        <p>
          Ivor is 12 when the Nazis march into his village in Hungary. His
          father and eldest brother are immediately sent to a labour battalion
          and the remaining family, to the ghetto, where they are eventually
          rounded up, herded to the station and pushed onto cattle trucks. On
          arrival at Auschwitz, his mother insists he leaves his sisters and
          younger siblings and stands with his two older brothers. Told to say
          he is sixteen, he makes the selection alongside them. In the shower
          blocks, he is disinfected, shaved, uniformed, given a number and
          marched to a barracks where his eldest brother is taken to work in the
          crematorium.{" "}

          Ivor and his remaining brother, Alec spend the next 6 months
          witnessing the full horror of Birkenau. Soon after Ivor and Alec are
          miraculously reunited with their father, they are sent on another
          cattle truck to Kaufering IV where they are all put to work at Walnuss
          II. When Father and Alec are taken away at roll call, Ivor reaches his
          lowest point and by the time Alec returns 3 weeks later, he has
          contracted Typhus. Near to death, he is carried from the sick barracks
          by his brother.{" "}

          Realising the war is almost lost, a Nazi officer is ordered to lead
          them on a death march and kill them in the mountains. Fearing he will
          be tried for war crimes, he delivers them alive to Allach 6 days
          later. When an artillery shell destroys part of the fence, they escape
          into the woods and hide out in an abandoned hut. American soldiers
          break in looking for Nazis and explain the war is over and they must
          go to Dachau which has been liberated. Once there, they clean up and
          are given fresh clothes and food. After finding out they are the only
          survivors in the family, Ivor sneaks onto a bus to Munich and into a
          cinema where he sees his first-ever film. On a second trip, he is
          arrested and accused of black marketeering. Appearing in court the
          judge is shown his Dachau papers and allows him to go free. Ivor and
          Alec are sent to Feldafing, the camp for displaced persons. They
          attend a Kol Nidre service and light memorial candles. Being the
          youngest, they are soon put on a plane to the UK. Ivor, now 92,
          appears on screen in live action.
