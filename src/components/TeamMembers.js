The Evening Standard named Zoom as one of the Most Influential Londoners under 25 and his cartoon for Private Eye, ‘You can’t do anything these days without being seen as an antisemite’ won Pocket Political Cartoon of the Year 2023. After reading Ivor Perl’s story, Zoom said: “Ivor’s book moved me deeply. When I read Ivor’s words, I saw them as a film, and I realised that I could bring these images to life using my paper puppet animation skills and create something accessible to an audience who wouldn’t normally think of delving into this subject matter. Anti-Semitism is again on the rise and I have heard people say, Why are Jews always banging on about the Holocaust?" - This film is the answer to that question.'
